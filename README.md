# Ship Check 0 (Due Friday, Sept 12, 11:59 PM ET)

**Goal:** Prove your environment works and ship something tiny. Every repo has **two tracks**:

* A gentle **Baseline** (required) to check your setup.
* An optional **Hard Mode** (scored) that asks you to extend it with real persistence + tests.

**Repo naming (required):** `edge-f25-ship0-<onyen-or-last-first>`
**Visibility:** Public (or grant org access).
**Commits:** ≥2 (not one big dump).

---

## Tracks

* [**Python Ship Check**](https://github.com/Edge-Carolina/ship0-template-python): Baseline = run an env check script + set a semester goal.
  Hard Mode = build a tiny CLI with persistence + pytest.

* [**Node/JS Ship Check**](https://github.com/Edge-Carolina/ship0-template-node): Baseline = browser app that saves entries in localStorage.
  Hard Mode = add edit/delete/filter logic with tests (Vitest).

Pick whichever language track you want. Everyone must finish **Baseline**. Hard Mode is optional but recommended if you’re comfortable.

---

## Submission (required)

* Fill the **[Ship Check 0 Submission Form](https://forms.gle/4mGYjAZ4BKYZHUg2A)** with:

  * Repo URL
  * Screenshot URL (or confirm it’s in the repo)
  * Track + Baseline/Hard Mode, minutes spent, biggest blocker

**Miss the deadline = dropped.** Roster locks after Week 2.
