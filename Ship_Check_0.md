# Ship Check 0 (Due Friday, Sept 12, 5:00 PM ET)

**Goal:** Prove your environment works and ship something tiny. Choose **one** option.

**Repo naming (required):** `edge-f25-ship0-<onyen-or-last-first>`  
**Visibility:** Public (or grant access to the org).  
**Commits:** ≥2 (not one big dump).

---

## Option A — Apprentice (Python): Env Check + Mini Task

**Files**
- `env_check.py`
- `goals.txt` — first line = your 1-sentence “what I want to build this semester”
- `README.md` — run steps + pasted output
- `screenshots/run.png` — terminal screenshot

**`env_check.py` must print:**
- Your full name
- Python version
- `numpy` version
- First line of `goals.txt`

**Pass if all true**
- Script runs in a clean venv without errors
- README has run commands + output example
- Screenshot present
- Repo name matches

---

## Option B — Core (Node): Ship Log (localStorage)

**App requirements**
- Title: **“Edge Labs — Ship Log”**
- Text input + “Add Entry” button
- Entries persist to **localStorage**
- List shows newest first

**Files**
- Your app code (Vanilla or Vite React)
- `README.md` — how to run (`npm install`, `npm run dev` or `npm start`), two bullets on semester goals
- `public/screenshot.png` (or similar) — app with ≥2 entries

**Pass if all true**
- App runs locally from clean checkout
- Entries persist across refresh
- README has run steps + goals
- Screenshot present
- Repo name matches

---

## Submission (required)
- Fill the **[Ship Check 0 Submission Form](https://forms.gle/4mGYjAZ4BKYZHUg2A)** with:
  - Repo URL
  - Screenshot URL (or confirm it’s in the repo)
  - Track (Apprentice/Core), minutes spent, biggest blocker

**Miss the deadline = dropped.** Roster locks after Week 2.
